# Using Ansible 2.10.0a1 under Azure there might happen that the output of a
# task is changed if a module uses no_log = True for an attribute.
#
# For example, if the output of the module should contain "changed: True", and
# an attribute with no_log set contains the value `hang` it might happen that
# the output is modified to "c******ed: True", and if this output is further
# processed (registering the result and comparing the value of `changed`),
# the test might fail, but not because of module code, but because of unexpected
# output processing.
#
# This behavior was, currently, only reproduced with Ansible 2.10.0a1 running
# under Azure.
