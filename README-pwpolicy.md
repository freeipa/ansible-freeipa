Usage
=====

Example inventory file

```ini
[ipaserver]
ipaserver.test.local
```


Example playbook to ensure presence of pwpolicies for exisiting group ops:

```yaml
  tasks:
  - name: Ensure presence of pwpolicies for group ops
    ipapwpolicy:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: ops
      minlife: 7
      maxlife: 49
      history: 5
      priority: 1
      lockouttime: 300
      minlength: 8
      maxfail: 3
```

Example playbook to ensure absence of pwpolicies for group ops:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle pwpolicies
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Ensure absence of pwpolicies for group ops
  - ipapwpolicy:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: ops
      state: absent
```

Example playbook to ensure maxlife is set to 49 in global policy:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle pwpolicies
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Ensure maxlife is set to 49 in global policy
  - ipapwpolicy:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      maxlife: 49
```

Example playbook to ensure password grace period is set to 3 in global policy:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle pwpolicies
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Ensure maxlife is set to 49 in global policy
  - ipapwpolicy:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      gracelimit: 3
```

Example playbook to ensure password grace period is set to unlimited in global policy:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle pwpolicies
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Ensure maxlife is set to 49 in global policy
  - ipapwpolicy:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      gracelimit: -1
```
