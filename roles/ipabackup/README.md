Usage
=====

Example inventory file with fixed domain and realm, setting up of the DNS server and using forwarders from /etc/resolv.conf:

```ini
[ipaserver]
ipaserver.example.com
```

Example playbook to create a backup on the IPA server locally:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to backup IPA server
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  roles:
  - role: ipabackup
    state: present
```


Example playbook to create a backup of the IPA server that is transferred to the controller using the server name as prefix for the backup and removed on the server:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to backup IPA server to controller
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  vars:
    ipabackup_to_controller: yes
    # ipabackup_keep_on_server: yes

  roles:
  - role: ipabackup
    state: present
```
