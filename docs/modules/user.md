User module
===========

Description
-----------

The user module allows to ensure presence, absence, disablement, unlocking and undeletion of users.

The user module is as compatible as possible to the Ansible upstream `ipa_user` module, but additionally offers to preserve delete, enable, disable, unlock and undelete users.


Features
--------
* User management


Supported FreeIPA Versions
--------------------------

FreeIPA versions 4.4.0 and up are supported by the ipauser module.


Requirements
------------

**Controller**
* Ansible version: 2.8+

**Node**
* Supported FreeIPA version (see above)


Usage
=====

Example inventory file

```ini
[ipaserver]
ipaserver.test.local
```


Example playbook to ensure a user is present:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle users
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Ensure user pinky is present
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: pinky
      first: pinky
      last: Acme
      uid: 10001
      gid: 100
      phone: "+555123457"
      email: pinky@acme.com
      passwordexpiration: "2023-01-19 23:59:59"
      password: "no-brain"
      update_password: on_create

  # Ensure user brain is present
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: brain
      first: brain
      last: Acme
```
`update_password` controls if a password for a user will be set in present state only on creation or every time (always).


These two `ipauser` module calls can be combined into one with the `users` variable:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle users
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Ensure users pinky and brain are present
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      users:
      - name: pinky
        first: pinky
        last: Acme
        uid: 10001
        gid: 100
        phone: "+555123457"
        email: pinky@acme.com
        passwordexpiration: "2023-01-19 23:59:59"
        password: "no-brain"
      - name: brain
        first: brain
        last: Acme
      update_password: on_create
```

You can also alternatively use a json file containing the users, here `users_present.json`:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "user1",
      "first": "First 1",
      "last": "Last 1"
    },
    {
      "name": "user2",
      "first": "First 2",
      "last": "Last 2"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

And ensure the presence of the users with this example playbook:

```yaml
---
- name: Tests
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
  - name: Include users_present.json
    include_vars:
      file: users_present.json

  - name: Users present
    ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      users: "{{ users }}"
```

Ensure user pinky is present with a generated random password and print the random password:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle users
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Ensure user pinky is present with a random password
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: brain
      first: brain
      last: Acme
      random: yes
    register: ipauser

  - name: Print generated random password
    debug:
      var: ipauser.user.randompassword
```

Ensure users pinky and brain are present with a generated random password and print the random passwords:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle users
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Ensure users pinky and brain are present with random password
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      users:
      - name: pinky
        first: pinky
        last: Acme
        uid: 10001
        gid: 100
        phone: "+555123457"
        email: pinky@acme.com
        passwordexpiration: "2023-01-19 23:59:59"
        password: "no-brain"
      - name: brain
        first: brain
        last: Acme
    register: ipauser

  - name: Print generated random password of pinky
    debug:
      var: ipauser.user.pinky.randompassword

  - name: Print generated random password of brain
    debug:
      var: ipauser.user.brain.randompassword
```

Example playbook to delete a user, but preserve it:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle users
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Remove but preserve user pinky
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: pinky
      preserve: yes
      state: absent
```

This can also be done with the `users` variable containing only names, this can be combined into one module call:

Example playbook to delete a user, but preserve it using the `users` variable:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle users
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Remove but preserve user pinky
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      users:
      - name: pinky
      preserve: yes
      state: absent
```

This can also be done as an alternative with the `users` variable containing only names.


Example playbook to undelete a preserved user.

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle users
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Undelete preserved user pinky
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: pinky
      state: undeleted
```

This can also be done as an alternative with the `users` variable containing only names.


Example playbook to disable a user:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle users
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Disable user pinky
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: pinky
      state: disabled
```

This can also be done as an alternative with the `users` variable containing only names.


Example playbook to enable users:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle users
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Enable user pinky and brain
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: pinky,brain
      state: enabled
```

This can also be done as an alternative with the `users` variable containing only names.


Example playbook to unlock users:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle users
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Unlock user pinky and brain
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: pinky,brain
      state: unlocked
```


Example playbook to ensure users are absent:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle users
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Ensure users pinky and brain are absent
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: pinky,brain
      state: absent
```

This can also be done as an alternative with the `users` variable containing only names.


Example playbook to ensure users are absent:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle users
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  # Ensure users pinky and brain are absent
  - ipauser:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      users:
      - name: pinky
      - name: brain
      state: absent
```
