DNSZone Module
==============

Description
-----------

The dnszone module allows to configure zones in DNS server.


Features
--------

* Add, remove, modify, enable or disable DNS zones.


Supported FreeIPA Versions
--------------------------

FreeIPA versions 4.4.0 and up are supported by ipadnszone module.


Requirements
------------

**Controller**
* Ansible version: 2.8+


**Node**
* Supported FreeIPA version (see above)


Usage
-----


```ini
[ipaserver]
ipaserver.test.local
```

Example playbook to create a simple DNS zone:

```yaml

---
- name: dnszone present
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Ensure zone is present.
    ipadnszone:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: testzone.local
      state: present

```


Example playbook to create a DNS zone with all currently supported variables:
```yaml

---
- name: dnszone present
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Ensure zone is present.
    ipadnszone:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: testzone.local
      allow_sync_ptr: true
      dynamic_update: true
      dnssec: true
      allow_transfer:
        - 1.1.1.1
        - 2.2.2.2
      allow_query:
        - 1.1.1.1
        - 2.2.2.2
      forwarders:
        - ip_address: 8.8.8.8
        - ip_address: 8.8.4.4
          port: 52
      serial: 1234
      refresh: 3600
      retry: 900
      expire: 1209600
      minimum: 3600
      ttl: 60
      default_ttl: 90
      name_server: ipaserver.test.local.
      admin_email: admin.admin@example.com
      nsec3param_rec: "1 7 100 0123456789abcdef"
      skip_overlap_check: true
      skip_nameserver_check: true
      state: present
```


Example playbook to disable a zone:

```yaml

---
- name: Playbook to disable DNS zone
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Disable zone.
    ipadnszone:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: testzone.local
      state: disabled
```


Example playbook to enable a zone:
```yaml

---
- name: Playbook to enable DNS zone
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Enable zone.
    ipadnszone:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: testzone.local
      state: enabled
```


Example playbook to remove a zone:
```yaml

---
- name: Playbook to remove DNS zone
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Remove zone.
    ipadnszone:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: testzone.local
      state: absent

```

Example playbook to create a zone for reverse DNS lookup, from an IP address:

```yaml

---
- name: dnszone present
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Ensure zone for reverse DNS lookup is present.
    ipadnszone:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name_from_ip: 192.168.1.2
      state: present
```

Note that, on the previous example the zone created with `name_from_ip` might be "1.168.192.in-addr.arpa.", "168.192.in-addr.arpa.", or "192.in-addr.arpa.", depending on the DNS response the system get while querying for zones, and for this reason, when creating a zone using `name_from_ip`, the inferred zone name is returned to the controller, in the attribute `dnszone.name`. Since the zone inferred might not be what a user expects, `name_from_ip` can only be used with `state: present`. To have more control over the zone name, the prefix length for the IP address can be provided.

Example playbook to create a zone for reverse DNS lookup, from an IP address, given the prefix length and displaying the resulting zone name:

```yaml

---
- name: dnszone present
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Ensure zone for reverse DNS lookup is present.
    ipadnszone:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name_from_ip: 192.168.1.2/24
      state: present
    register: result
  - name: Display inferred zone name.
    debug:
      msg: "Zone name: {{ result.dnszone.name }}"
```
