  become: yes

  tasks:
  - name: Ensure permission MyPermission is present
    ipapermission:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: MyPermission
      object_type: host
      right: all
```


Example playbook to ensure permission "MyPermission" is present with attr carlicense:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle IPA permissions
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: yes

  tasks:
  - name: Ensure permission "MyPermission" is present with attr carlicense
    ipapermission:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: MyPermission
      object_type: host
      right: all
      attrs:

      - gecos
      action: member
