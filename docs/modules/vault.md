Vault module
===================

Description
-----------

The vault module allows to ensure presence and absence of vault and members of vaults.

The vault module is as compatible as possible to the Ansible upstream `ipa_vault` module, and additionally offers to make sure that vault members, groups and owners are present or absent in a vault, and allow the archival of data in vaults.


Features
--------
* Vault management


Supported FreeIPA Versions
--------------------------

FreeIPA versions 4.4.0 and up are supported by the ipavault module.


Requirements
------------

**Controller**
* Ansible version: 2.8+

**Node**
* Supported FreeIPA version (see above)
* KRA service must be enabled


Usage
=====

Example inventory file

```ini
[ipaserver]
ipaserver.test.local
```

Example playbook to make sure vault is present (by default, vault type is `symmetric`):

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: symvault
      password: SomeVAULTpassword
      description: A standard private vault.
```

Example playbook to make sure that a vault and its members are present:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      users: user01
```

`action` controls if the vault, data, member or owner will be handled. To add or remove members or vault data, set `action` to `member`.

Example playbook to make sure that a vault member is present in vault:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      users: user01
      action: member
```

Example playbook to make sure that a vault owner is absent in vault:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      owner: user01
      action: member
      state: absent
```

Example playbook to make sure vault data is present in a symmetric vault:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      password: SomeVAULTpassword
      data: >
        Data archived.
        More data archived.
      action: member
```

When retrieving data from a vault, it is recommended that `no_log: yes` is used, so that sensitive data stored in a vault is not logged by Ansible. The data is returned in a dict `vault`, in the field `data` (e.g. `result.vault.data`). An example playbook to retrieve data from a symmetric vault:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - name: Retrieve data from vault and register it in 'ipavault'
    ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      password: SomeVAULTpassword
      state: retrieved
    no_log: yes
    register: ipavault

  - name: Print retrieved data from vault
    debug:
      var: ipavault.vault.data
```

Example playbook to make sure vault data is absent in a symmetric vault:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      password: SomeVAULTpassword
      action: member
      state: absent
```

Example playbook to change the password of a symmetric:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: symvault
      old_password: SomeVAULTpassword
      new_password: SomeNEWpassword
```

Example playbook to make sure vault is absent:

```yaml
---
- name: Playbook to handle vaults
  hosts: ipaserver
  become: true

  tasks:
  - ipavault:
      ipaadmin_password: SomeADMINpassword
      name: symvault
      username: admin
      state: absent
    register: result
  - debug:
      msg: "{{ result.vault.data }}"
```
